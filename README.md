# Swift movies
Purpose of this reposity is to dive into Swift by building [this application](https://framer.cloud/yrDqW) without any dependencies.

Things I am going to learn with this project:
- layout with code only
- http requests
- handling JSON
- adding multiple screen
- communicating between screens
- some animations

## Running the app
1. Clone repository
2. Create file `keys.plist` under `SwiftMovies` folder
3. Add key `ApiKey` with [The Movie Database API key](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) as its value
