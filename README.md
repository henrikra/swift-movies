# Swift movies
Purpose of this reposity is to dive into Swift by building [this application](https://framer.cloud/yrDqW) without any dependencies.

Things I am going to learn with this project:
- layout with code only
- http requests
- handling JSON
- adding multiple screen
- communicating between screens
- some animations
